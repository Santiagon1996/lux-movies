# ðŸŽ¬ LuxMovies App

**Technical Challenge for LuxExperience**

LuxMovies App is a **full-stack web application** created as a technical challenge for the Frontend Engineer position at LuxExperience. Its goal is to implement a comprehensive solution for browsing movies, viewing their details, and managing a wish list.

The project is designed to demonstrate skills in structuring, developing, and managing both client-side and server-side code.

### Key Features

- **Category Browsing:** The homepage features movie carousels with different categories.
- **Detail Pages:** Clicking on a movie navigates to a dedicated page that displays a description, an image, and a button to add it to a wish list.
- **Wish List:** A separate section where all added movies can be viewed.

### Architecture and Technology

- **Frontend:** Built with **React** and **TypeScript**.
- **Styling:** Styled using **SCSS**, without the use of CSS Modules, Styled Components, or Tailwind.
- **Build Tool:** **Vite** is used for bundling, with support for **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)**.
- **Architecture:** The codebase is handcrafted to showcase the ability to structure a project from scratch without full-stack frameworks like Next.js.
- **API:** The application connects to an external API (The Movie Database API is recommended) to fetch movie data.

### Evaluation Criteria

This project was optimized to meet the following evaluation criteria:

- **Code Quality:** Clean, reusable, and well-structured component-based code.
- **Development Principles:** Adherence to **DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)** principles.
- **Testing:** Comprehensive unit tests with Jest and integration tests with curl scripts.
- **SSR Strategy:** Implementation of an effective Server-Side Rendering strategy.
